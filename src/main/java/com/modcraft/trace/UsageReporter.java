/**
 * Reports a single {@code startup} event to the trace usage-tracking service once the
 * application is ready, and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>What is sent: the program name ({@value #APPLICATION}), the event name, the service's own
 * version (the Maven project version, or the jar's {@code Implementation-Version} when the
 * property is absent) and the static tag {@code service=true}, which marks it as a self-hosted
 * service. Nothing per request, and nothing about mods, modpacks, users, hosts or addresses is
 * ever included.
 *
 * <p>The event is sent by {@link TraceClient}, which returns immediately, never throws, and
 * queues at most {@link TraceClient#QUEUE_CAPACITY} reports, so an unreachable trace server
 * costs the service nothing but a dropped report. Reporting is on by default and is configured
 * through the {@code usage-reporting.*} properties in {@code application.properties} (each with
 * an environment override): set {@code usage-reporting.enabled=false} (or the
 * {@code USAGE_REPORTING_ENABLED=false} environment variable) to turn it off. A blank key also disables it, and a
 * malformed endpoint yields a disabled client rather than a failed start-up.
 * {@code TRACE_USAGE_REPORTING=off} and {@code DO_NOT_TRACK=1} in the environment turn it off
 * too: the client checks those two itself, before this program's own setting, so they always
 * win. Details: {@value #DETAILS_URL}.
